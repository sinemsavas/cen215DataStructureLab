## Homework 2

Update your homework 1 by including **Quick** and **Heap** sort, and their performances. Don't forget to update your screenshot. Send **Pull Request** with only changed 2 files(*foo*.c and *bar*.png) which will only include this week topics. Do not alter your previous week code.  
If you didn't submit previous homework, please submit complete (hw1 + hw2) homework. Create your own folder under sorting folder.
